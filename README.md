# Njuskalo-Notificator
Small python program for croatian site njuskalo
Primarily made for quick notification when something new arrives to njuskalo

This is small student "project" to help monitor prices of iphones (or somthing else) on croatian second hand market
It uses basic "data management" and it's not pretty, but it does work done :)
